# Zamio Stations Onboarding Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of the multi-step station onboarding system for zamio_stations based on the proven structure from zamio_frontend. **DEMO-ONLY implementation with NO backend connections** - all steps will use mock data and demo states only.

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Project Structure Adaptation
- **Base**: Use zamio_frontend onboarding as foundation
- **Adaptation**: Modify for station-specific requirements
- **Integration**: Work with existing zamio_stations architecture
- **Styling**: Match existing Tailwind/styling patterns

### Station-Specific Features
- **Stream Links**: Audio stream configuration and monitoring
- **Compliance**: Ghana broadcasting regulations and licensing
- **Staff Roles**: Station manager, reporters, compliance officers
- **Payment**: Station revenue collection and payouts
- **Monitoring**: Airplay tracking and reporting setup

### Step Completion Logic
- **Required steps**: Profile, Stream Setup (must complete)
- **Optional steps**: Staff, Compliance, Payment (can skip)
- **Auto-progression**: Move to next incomplete required step
- **Manual navigation**: Users can jump between completed steps

### Demo Flow
```
Sign Up ‚Üí Email Verification ‚Üí Onboarding (Welcome ‚Üí Profile ‚Üí Stream ‚Üí Staff ‚Üí Compliance ‚Üí Payment) ‚Üí Dashboard
```

## üöÄ Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete onboarding flow works end-to-end
- [ ] All 6 steps are functional as demo pages
- [ ] Step progression and navigation works
- [ ] Responsive design on all screen sizes
- [ ] Consistent styling with existing zamio_stations theme
- [ ] No console errors or broken functionality

## üé® Styling Requirements

### Project Theme Integration
- **Styling**: Use direct Tailwind classes matching zamio_stations patterns
  - Dark backgrounds: `bg-slate-950`, `bg-slate-900/60`
  - Text colors: `text-white`, `text-slate-200`, `text-slate-300`, `text-slate-400`
  - Accent colors: `indigo-500`, `indigo-400`, `indigo-300`
  - Borders: `border-white/10`, `border-white/20`
  - Effects: `backdrop-blur`, `shadow-2xl`
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons (Radio, Users, Settings, CheckCircle, etc.)
- **Layout**: Container-based responsive design
- **No theme context** - use direct class implementations

### Ghana-Specific Features
- Mobile money integration (MTN, Vodafone, AirtelTigo)
- Broadcasting license verification
- Local regulatory compliance messaging
- Regional station management features

## üîß Technical Approach

### Component Architecture
1. **OnboardingWizard**: Generic wizard component (reusable)
2. **StationOnboarding**: Main orchestrator with state management
3. **Step Components**: Individual step implementations
4. **Context/Hooks**: State management and business logic
5. **Utils**: Route mapping and helper functions

### State Management Strategy
- **Context**: StationOnboardingContext for global state
- **Local State**: Individual steps manage their own form data
- **Persistence**: localStorage for progress (demo mode)
- **Validation**: Step-level validation before progression

### Integration Points
- **Router**: Add `/onboarding` route with step routing
- **Auth Flow**: Redirect to onboarding after email verification
- **Dashboard**: Onboarding completion navigates to dashboard
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs and progress indicators
