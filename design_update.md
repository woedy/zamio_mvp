## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
1. **Start with Priority 1** - Core data visualization improvements
2. **Implement in phases** - Group related tasks together
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure changes work across all screen sizes
4. **Maintain performance** - Avoid heavy animations that impact load times

### Quality Standards
- **Cross-browser compatibility** - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile responsiveness** - Ensure all improvements work on mobile
- **Dark mode compatibility** - All changes should support both themes
- **Performance impact** - Monitor for any performance regressions

## 📝 Notes
- Mark completed tasks with [x] and add completion dates
- Add implementation notes for complex features
- Update priority levels as business needs evolve
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing future enhancements
