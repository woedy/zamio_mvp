# ZamIO Admin Partners Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Partners management system for the ZamIO Admin platform. Partners are divided into two main types:

- **Local Partners**: Ghanaian PROs like GHAMRO and other local collecting societies
- **International Partners**: Global PROs like ASCAP, BMI, PRS for Music, etc.

All implementation will use static demo data with no server connections. Each task will be checked off upon completion.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Planning and Data Structure
- [x] Review partner data structure and requirements from `zamio_admin copy`
- [x] Define partner types (Local vs International) and their specific data fields
- [x] Create mock data for sample local and international partners
- [x] Design partner relationship model (agreements, territories, fees)

### Phase 2: Partners Overview Page
- [x] Create main Partners page (`/partners`) with overview dashboard
- [x] Implement partner type filtering (Local/International tabs)
- [x] Add partner summary cards (total partners, active agreements, territories covered)
- [x] Create partner list/table with key information display
- [x] Add search and filter functionality for partners

### Phase 3: Partner Detail Pages
- [x] Create partner detail page structure (`/partners/:type/:id`)
- [x] Implement Local Partner detail view with Ghana-specific data
- [x] Implement International Partner detail view with global data
- [x] Add partner profile information (contact, status, join date)
- [x] Include partner performance metrics and activity logs

### Phase 4: Agreement Management
- [ ] Create agreement overview section in partner details
- [ ] Implement active agreements list with status and expiry tracking
- [ ] Add agreement creation/editing interface (UI only)
- [ ] Include territory mapping and coverage visualization
- [ ] Add agreement performance metrics (collection rates, disputes)
- [ ] **Implement Reciprocal Agreement management** - Handle agreements between PROs for cross-border royalty collection
- [ ] **Add international royalty collection tracking** - Monitor collections from international partners and territories

### Phase 5: Integration and Navigation
- [x] Add Partners navigation item to admin sidebar
- [x] Update routing for partners pages (`/partners`, `/partners/:type/:id`)
- [x] Integrate with existing admin layout and theming
- [x] Add breadcrumb navigation and back buttons
- [x] Ensure responsive design for all partner pages

### Phase 6: Demo Data and Content
- [x] Populate realistic demo data for local partners (GHAMRO, etc.)
- [x] Add sample international partners (ASCAP, BMI, PRS)
- [x] Create mock agreements, territories, and performance data
- [x] Ensure data reflects Ghanaian and international music industry context

### Phase 7: UI/UX Polish and Testing
- [x] Apply consistent styling with existing admin pages
- [x] Add loading states and error handling (UI level)
- [x] Implement hover effects and interactive elements
- [x] Test all partner pages in light and dark modes
- [x] Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness

### Phase 8: Documentation and Final Review
- [x] Document partner management features and data structures
- [x] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [x] Review implementation against original requirements
- [x] Prepare for backend integration points

## Success Criteria
- Partners page provides clear overview of local and international relationships
