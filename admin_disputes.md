# ZamIO Admin Disputes Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the Disputes management system for the ZamIO Admin platform. The admin interface will manage all disputes flagged by stations across the platform, providing oversight and resolution capabilities for cross-station issues.

Admin disputes management focuses on:
- **Station-flagged disputes**: Issues reported by individual stations
- **Cross-station coordination**: Managing disputes that affect multiple stations
- **Resolution workflows**: Admin-level dispute resolution processes
- **Analytics and reporting**: Overview of dispute patterns and resolutions

All implementation will use static demo data with no server connections. Each task will be checked off upon completion.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Planning and Data Structure
- [ ] Review dispute data structure and requirements from `zamio_admin copy`
- [ ] Define dispute types (station-flagged, cross-station, resolution status)
- [ ] Create mock data for sample disputes from various stations
- [ ] Design dispute workflow model (flagged → assigned → resolved)

### Phase 2: Disputes Overview Page
- [x] Create main Disputes page (`/disputes`) with overview dashboard
- [x] Implement dispute status filtering (open, in-progress, resolved, escalated)
- [x] Add dispute summary cards (total disputes, pending resolutions, station breakdown)
- [x] Create disputes list/table with key information display
- [x] Add search and filter functionality for disputes

### Phase 3: Dispute Detail Pages
- [x] Create dispute detail page structure (`/disputes/:id`)
- [x] Implement dispute information display (station, type, description, evidence)
- [x] Add dispute timeline and status tracking
- [x] Include resolution workflow (assign, escalate, resolve)
- [x] Add dispute notes and communication log

### Phase 4: Resolution Management
- [ ] Create resolution assignment system (assign to admin users)
- [ ] Implement resolution workflow states (investigating, pending info, resolved)
- [ ] Add escalation mechanisms for complex disputes
- [ ] Include dispute outcome tracking and reporting
- [ ] Add bulk resolution actions for multiple disputes

### Phase 5: Integration and Navigation
- [x] Add Disputes navigation item to admin sidebar
- [x] Update routing for disputes pages (`/disputes`, `/disputes/:id`)
- [x] Integrate with existing admin layout and theming
- [x] Add breadcrumb navigation and back buttons
- [x] Ensure responsive design for all dispute pages

### Phase 6: Analytics and Reporting
- [x] Create disputes analytics dashboard
- [x] Implement dispute trends and patterns visualization
- [x] Add station performance metrics related to disputes
- [x] Include resolution time tracking and reporting
- [x] Add export functionality for dispute reports

### Phase 7: Demo Data and Content
- [x] Populate realistic demo data for station-flagged disputes
- [x] Add sample disputes from various station types
- [x] Create mock resolution workflows and outcomes
- [x] Ensure data reflects real-world dispute scenarios

### Phase 8: UI/UX Polish and Testing
- [x] Apply consistent styling with existing admin pages
- [x] Add loading states and error handling (UI level)
- [x] Implement hover effects and interactive elements
- [x] Test all dispute pages in light and dark modes
- [x] Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness

### Phase 9: Documentation and Final Review
- [x] Document dispute management features and data structures
- [x] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [x] Review implementation against original requirements
- [x] Prepare for backend integration points

## Success Criteria
- Disputes page provides clear overview of all station-flagged issues
- Dispute details enable efficient resolution workflows
- Resolution management supports admin oversight and coordination
- Analytics provide insights into dispute patterns and station performance
- Demo data accurately represents real-world station dispute scenarios
- UI is consistent with ZamIO admin design standards
- All pages work seamlessly in the admin navigation flow

## Reference Materials
- `zamio_admin copy` - Design reference for admin interface patterns
- Existing admin pages (Dashboard, Partners, UserManagement) - Styling and layout consistency
- Station dispute context - Understanding of station-level dispute flagging
